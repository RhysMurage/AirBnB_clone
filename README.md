# AirBnB Clone

* This is the first step towards building a full web application: the  **AirBnB clone** .
* The project aims to:

  * put in place a parent class (called `BaseModel`) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
  * create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
  * create all classes used for AirBnB (`User`, `State`, `City`, `Place`…) that inherit from `BaseModel`
  * create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
  * create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
